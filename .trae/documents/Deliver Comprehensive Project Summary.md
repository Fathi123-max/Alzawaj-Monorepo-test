## Scope
Provide a concise, 1–2 page, structured project summary covering: Overview, Technical Specs, Architecture, Development Status, Team Structure, Timeline, Success Metrics, and Visual Aids. Strictly reflect repository evidence and clearly mark unknowns.

## Data Sources
- Package metadata (frontend and backend)
- OpenAPI spec and server code
- Directory structure for modules/components
- Environment configs and integration services
- Test/CI configs and TODO markers

## Deliverables
1. A formatted summary with clear section headings and bullet points.
2. File path and line-number references for key claims.
3. Visual aids if available; otherwise a brief textual architecture sketch.

## Follow-ups After Confirmation
- Refine unknowns (stakeholders, timeline, KPIs) based on your inputs.
- Optionally generate a simple architecture diagram from the textual overview.
- Align success metrics with business goals and instrument measurement plan.

## Assumptions
- Two-app architecture: Next.js frontend and Express/Mongoose backend.
- Integrations: ImageKit active; email/SMS placeholders; optional Redis; Socket.IO scaffolding.
- CI/CD: Render for backend; frontend likely Vercel.

## Risks
- Limited visibility on team, timeline, and real production metrics in repo.
- Some README screenshot references are missing; diagram generation may be required.
